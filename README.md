## Overview

Build Time Analyzer is a macOS app that shows you a break down of Swift build times. See [this post]( https://medium.com/p/fc92cdd91e31) and [this post](https://medium.com/p/37b0a7514cbe) on Medium for context. 

## Usage

Open up the app and follow the instructions.

## Installation

Download the code and open it in Xcode, archive the project and export the build. Easy, right?

If you are on Xcode 7, instead use the [Xcode plug-in](https://github.com/RobertGummesson/BuildTimeAnalyzer-for-Xcode/releases/tag/v0.0.0-Plugin-for-Xcode7).
